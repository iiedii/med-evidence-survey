<h2><em>Event name: Felling a tree</em></h2>

<p><em>Definition:</em> One or more people fell a tree</p>

<p><em>Explication:</em> Felling is the process of cutting down an individual tree
transforming its position from vertical to horizontal. Felling a tree
can be done by hand or with a motorized machine.  If done by hand, <b><font color="brown">it
usually involves a tool such as a saw, chainsaw, or axe.  A
tree-felling machine, known as a feller buncher, can also be
used.</font></b> Felling is part of the logging process, but can also be done to
single trees in non-logging contexts.  <b><font color="brown">possibly climbing the tree or
accessing upper parts of the tree from a cherry-picker bucket and then
cutting branches from the tree before felling it,</font></b> possibly cutting a
horizontal wedge from the tree's trunk to cause the tree to fall in a
desired direction, cutting horizontally through the trunk of the tree
with saw(s) or ax(es), <b><font color="brown">using wedges or rope(s) to prevent the tree
from falling in some particular direction (such as onto a house).</font></b><p>
