<h2><em>Event name: Non-motorized vehicle repair</em></h2>

<p><em>Definition:</em> One or more people make repairs to a non-motorized
vehicle.</p>

<p><em>Explication:</em> Non-motorized vehicles are devices designed to transport
humans and/or cargo, that are <b><font color="brown">NOT powered by a motor but rather human
effort, animal effort, or the environment</font></b>. They can operate on land,
(e.g. bicycles, wagons, skateboards), or water (e.g. sailboats,
paddleboats, rowboats). Non-motorized land vehicles generally have at
least two wheels but may use one or more wheels. Non-motorized
vehicles without wheels include sleds, sail boats and
surfboards. <b><font color="brown">Footwear with wheels such as rollerblades or rollerskates
are NOT considered vehicles.</font></b> Parts of the vehicles, such as the chain
on a bicycle, might be partially or completely removed for cleaning or
adjusting.</p>
