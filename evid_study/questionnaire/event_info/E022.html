<h2><em>Event Name: Cleaning an appliance</em></h2>

<p><em>Definition:</em> One or more people clean an appliance.</p>

<p><em>Explication:</em> Household appliances are machines that are used for
household functions such as cleaning, cooking, or cooling the
home. Major household appliances are typically large appliances that
are often metallic, black/white/beige/stainless steel in color, and
can include: air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes dryers, drying
cabinet, freezer, refrigerator, kitchen stove, water heater, washing
machine, trash compactor, microwave ovens and induction
cookers. Non-major household appliances are typically small appliances
that perform a more specialized task, and can include: coffee makers,
toasters, stand mixers, food processors, and electric can
openers. <b><font color="brown">Small devices that are held and moved with the hand while
operating them, such as hand mixers, hair dryers, or electric
toothbrushes, are NOT considered appliances</font></b> and therefore cleaning
these items is off-topic for this event.  <b><font color="brown">Cleaning an appliance
usually involves applying some kind of cleansing product to the
appliance and scrubbing by hand and/or rinsing it with water.</font></b> For a
refrigerator or freezer, cleaning may also involve simply removing
unwanted/old food items from the appliance. Cleaning of any appliance
may also <b><font color="brown">involve removing or disassembling some or all of the
appliance to clean some parts separately and/or get better access to
parts of the appliance to clean them.</font></b> For example, the drawers and
some shelves of a refrigerator may be removed and washed separately.</p>
