<h2><em>Event name: Wedding shower</em></h2>

<p><em>Definition:</em> An individual or couple celebrates their upcoming wedding
with family and/or friends.</p>

<p><em>Explication:</em> A wedding shower is a gathering of people who have been
invited by the host or hosts to <b><font color="brown">come to a set location (often a
private home, sometimes a restaurant, reception hall, park or other
public venue)</font></b> to socialize in honor of two people getting
married. Often wedding showers are <b><font color="brown">attended by women or women and
young children only, in which case the bride is the guest of honor,</font></b>
and the event may also be called a "bridal shower". The term "shower"
refers to the showering of the bride/couple with gifts, and guests are
expected to bring gifts (usually wrapped in paper or in decorative
gift bags). Often the bride/couple opens the gifts during the
party. The gifts are often household items (e.g. dishware, small
appliances, cooking tools, bath products), <b><font color="brown">often there is at least one
"sexy" gift (e.g. lingerie, massage oil). Often the person opening the
gift will hold up the gift for the guests to see, the guests will
verbally praise the gift, and pictures may be taken.</font></b> A wedding shower,
as with other parties/celebrations, will typically feature an
assortment of food and beverages. Wedding showers are sometimes
accompanied by decorations, such as balloons and streamers, which may
be in any color but often include white. <b><font color="brown">The decorations may include
signs or banners</font></b> displaying a message for the bride/couple, such as
"Congratulations (names of couple)" or "Best Wishes to (names of
couple)". Wedding showers <b><font color="brown">sometimes involve silly games</font></b> and
wedding/fertility themed games.</p>
