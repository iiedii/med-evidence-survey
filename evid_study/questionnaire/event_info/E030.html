<h2><em>Event Name: Working on a metal crafts project</em></h2>

<p><em>Definition:</em> One or more people fashion an object out of metal</p>

<p><em>Explication:</em> Working on a metal crafts project involves manipulating
metal to create a decorative and/or functional object, such as
jewelry, decorative wall hangings, or wrought-iron fences. <b><font color="brown">Objects
made in a factory or by operating a factory-style large machine do NOT
count as relevant for this event.</font></b> Metal may be manipulated by
bending/molding with a vice, hammer, or other instrument, <b><font color="brown">usually by
initially heating the metal</font></b>. This can be done by placing the
designated metal into a hot fire or with targeted heat from a
soldering iron or welding machine. Welding involves joining pieces of
metal by heating them until they are molten and then joining them
together. When metal is heated to this degree, it changes color to
glow an orange or bright yellow/white color. Thin pieces of metal may
have holes punched or drilled in them, either for decorative purposes
or to allow wire or piece of connecting material (e.g. screw) to be
passed through the hole.</p>
