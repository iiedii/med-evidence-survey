    <h2>Before start, please get to know your job:</h2>
    <p> For each of the following page, some pieces of evidence will be presented to you.
        <b><font color="brown">They all are from one single video.</font></b> You need
        to make a judgement <b><font color="brown">at your shortest convenient time</font></b>,
        predicting whether the video is relevant to the event. You need to choose one of the
        three answers:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em><b>Yes:</b> Inferring from the evidence, you are <b><font color="brown">certain</font></b> that the video is relevant.</em></li>
        <li><em><b>No:</b> Inferring from the evidence, you are <b><font color="brown">certain</font></b> that the video is irrelevant.</em></li>
        <li><em><b>Not sure:</b> You can not conclude from the evidence.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p> Be aware that the evidence is generated by different methods. You don't need to
        know from which method it is generated. The presentation of the evidence can be
        in either images or snippets. <b>For the snippet type of evidence, please mouseover
        the snippet to play it. Audio is also available when you play a snippet. Be prepared.</b>
    </p>
    <p> Note that your response time is also recorded. <mark><b>Please do this study EXCLUSIVELY.
        It is recommended you take a rest only once you finish a whole event. Log out manually. DO
        NOT hold on the question page if you were to have a break or were interrupted.</b></mark>
        Log out and log back in in this case to proceed the study.
    </p>
